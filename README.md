#A cross-platform 2d rendering library called "Zero-Z" (zz)

## Installation
Install [Haxe](http://haxe.org/download) and run `$ haxelib install polygonal-zz` from the console.
This installs the polygonal-zz library hosted on [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org/p/polygonal-zz), which always mirrors the git master branch. From now on just compile with `$ haxe ... -lib polygonal-zz`.
If you want to test the latest beta build, you should pull the dev branch and add the src folder to the classpath via `$ haxe ... -cp src`.
